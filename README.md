## Description

This is the Android client for my [Android Malware Classifier](https://github.com/MartGon/MalwareClassifier).

After launching the app, you can select the APK from your system which you would like to analyze. Once the analysis is over, a number will displayed. This number is a percent of how likely the selected application is to be a malware sample. The lower this value is, the better.

By pressing the "More information" button, you can examine some of the static features found on this application, such as its requested permissions or functionalities employed.

# About

I've tested the application with itself and it gave it 12.5% as result.
